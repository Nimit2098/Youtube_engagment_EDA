# Youtube Engagment EDA
The first step will be to sert up a youtube api credentials. I had taken guidance from a youtube video i have linked it down below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY8dhl1EQfI&t=614s

You can download data_extraction.ipynb in the folder you choose and keep the code file with the youtube api credentials.

Once we run this python code, there will be 2 output files. The first file will be a .json file with the categorical data of the videos and the other will be a .csv file named "youtube_data_preprocessed.csv" that will have the dataframe stored in it. At this point the extraction of the data using the youtube api will be complete.

After the above step you can make a fresh notebook to clean and transform the data or you can use my notebook that is youtube_EDA.ipynb and mess around till you are satisfied. The output of this file will be "youtube_data_postprocessed.csv", which has cleaned and necessary features in the dataset.

Last thing is to download the "Dashboard_youtube.pbix" in the same folder as other files.

Please run the above file in PowerBi and you can have the interactive dashboard that looks something like:
You can also find the snippet in the folder by the file named: Dashboard_snippet.png
![Getting Started](./Youtube\Dashboard_snippet.png)

The dashboard is interactive and has tooltips for additional information on all the plots and visuals.
